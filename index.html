          Poverty is more than just the lack of income, resources, or ensuring a
          sustainable<br />
          source of livelihood, as its manifestations include hunger,
          malnutrition, <br />
          limited access to education and basic services, in addition to social
          discrimination, exclusion from society,<br />
          and lack of opportunities to participate in decision-making.<br />
          Poverty is also known as one of the most serious and important
          problems facing society throughout its life.<br />
          This is because poverty puts the person in constant need, and he is
          unable to meet his simple requests, even if these needs are
          necessary.<br />
          Poverty is one of the misfortunes that a person faces in life. <br />
          They always feel hungry and thirsty. And the inability to have
          anything to cover it Of clothes too.
